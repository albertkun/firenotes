# FireNotes Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-10-30

FireNotes is designed with privacy by default. It does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data.

## What data is collected
- None. FireNotes does not collect analytics, telemetry, or any usage data.
- No information is sent to any server or third party.

## Where your data lives
- Your notes are stored locally in your browser using `browser.storage.local` within your Firefox profile.
- Data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export or copy it yourself.

## Clipboard usage
- Clipboard access is used only when you click the "Copy" button or the "Paste as plain text" button.
- Clipboard contents are never transmitted and are not stored beyond your current session’s note content.
- The extension does not monitor the clipboard in the background.

## Permissions used
- `storage`: Store your notes locally in the browser.
- `clipboardRead` and `clipboardWrite`: Enable the copy and paste-as-plain-text features initiated by you.

## Network access
- The extension makes no network requests and has no host permissions.

## Data retention and deletion
- Notes persist locally until you delete them:
  - Use the in-app delete controls to remove notes, or
  - Remove the extension from `about:addons` to delete its local storage.

## Third parties
- No third-party services are integrated. No data sharing occurs.

## Children’s privacy
- FireNotes does not target or market to children and does not collect any data.

## Changes to this policy
- If this policy changes, the "Effective date" above will be updated. Material changes will be reflected in the repository.
